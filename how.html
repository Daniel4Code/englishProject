                    People continued to buy the stock as it rose, and the stock continued to rise. Within hours, the
                    stock had risen from
                    the twenties to the 100s and then to the 200s. People believed they had won. There were posts on
                    wallstreetbets about
                    people gaining thousands of dollars and being able to retire, but all good things must come to an

                    People believe that when they buy or sell a security, they receive the shares or cash right away.
                    But this isn't true,
                    and it's something that a lot of people don't realize and that is key to understanding what happened
                    to GME.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let's start with the differences between settled and unsettled cash in the world of cash accounts.
                    Settled cash is cash
                    that has been settled after the T+2 (trade date plus two days) period, which simply implies that if
                    you sell a stock on
                    Monday, you will receive settled cash on Wednesday. You may say that when I sell a stock, I get
                    money
                    right away and can
                    trade with the money from the previous transaction. However, until the two days have gone, the cash
                    from the exchange in
                    cash accounts is considered unsettled cash. You can buy stock with this unsettled cash, but you
                    won't be able to sell it
                    or withdraw the money without penalty. It works differently with margin accounts because you can
                    borrow funds to trade
                    the securities you want.
