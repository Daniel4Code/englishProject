                    Keith Gill commented initially about his GameStop position on the subreddit wallstreetbets with the
                    username
                    deepfuckvalue on September 8, 2019. Wallstreetbets was founded in 2012 by Jaime Rogozinski, who has
                    been publicly
                    criticized by the site's current moderators. Many people were unaware of the subreddit before the
                    GME saga began in late
                    2020. The subreddit was once mostly used for DD (Due Diligence) posts and an abundance of Loss and
                    Gain post.

                    Shortly after posting on Wallstreetbets, he went on his Roaring Kitty YouTube channel to broadcast
                    extensive live
                    broadcasts about his thesis on Gamestop.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    His thesis on Gamestop was straightforward. People will continue to shop for video games at
                    Gamestop, and as the company
                    evolves into a more online-friendly company, it will not be damaged by huge companies such as Amazon
                    and Walmart.
                    Furthermore, the stock had a large short interest, indicating that many investors were speculating
                    on the stock falling.
                    Micheal Burry, the man who forecast the housing crisis, was also an investor in the stock aswell.
                    The high short
                    interest might appear as a bad thing but this opened a door for a short squeeze to happen.

                    <br>
                    There were several other heavily shorted companies engaged in the story, such as AMC and Bed Bath &
                    Beyond, but GameStop
                    was the main stock in the saga.
