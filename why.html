                    People joined the GameStop movement mostly with the purpose of making money. People may claim that
                    they did it to
                    demonstrate the big men, but it only accounts for a small portion of the population. Many of the
                    people who bought GME
                    in the $20-50 area did so because they believed in the company or wanted to show it to the big guys.
                    However, as more
                    individuals joined the movement, it became more saturated, and more people who were just looking for
                    a fast profit
                    bought the shares.

                    In 2008, a major financial disaster known as the housing crisis occurred. In brief, banks took a
                    significant risk by
                    betting on something that would never happen. And when that happened, which wasn't a surprise, they
                    lost a lot of money,
                    and their clients, who were ordinary people, had to pay the bill. What happened was that the
                    government bailed out the
                    banks, the executives were given large salaries, and the banks were not punished. The ordinary
                    person lost his or her
                    money as well as his or her job. The ordinary person lost his or her money as well as his or her
                    job. Occupy Wall Street
                    was one of the outcomes of the financial crisis, with activists opposing wealth inequality and the
                    power of money in
                    politics. The question was not one of left or right, but rather one of bipartisan, on which everyone
                    agreed. People
                    believed that as the financial sector became more deregulated, Wall Street would become increasingly
                    corrupt. The
                    political system is divided on how to address the wealth gap, and this disagreement persists in the
                    current political
                    context. Many people were dissatisfied with the outcome of the crisis, and they viewed this as an
                    opportunity to show
                    hedge funds that little people matter. Melvin Capital, one of the hedge institutions that shorted
                    GME, actually closed
                    down as a result of the losses. In the eyes of the Redditors, this was a success.
