                The age-old question. Clearly, the movement had a significant impact. The Redditors were victorious; they shut down
                hedge funds and made money. People also got a taste of the American financial system and witnessed its downfalls.
                Millions of new individuals started investing for their futures, but the pitfall of having such an unregulated market
                was ultimately recognized. How is it feasible for a stock's float to be shorted by more than 100%? Some of these funds
                were taking risks that I could never have imagined.

                However, I believe it is critical to use this as a stepping stone to the future. The SEC needs to do a better job of
                protecting the financial system and stop wasting taxpayers' money with these ineffective ads.

                To make them more fair for the retail investor, Brokerages need to work on speedier settlement techniques. There will
                also be more transparency with large short positions on companies, making the market fairer to the little guys. The
                market is already skewed against the little person, with institutions accounting for more than 85% of trading volume.

                Is it possible that this will happen again?
                It is extremely improbable that an incident of this magnitude will occur again, as a stock being shorted above 100% of
                its float is extremely rare and risky. It might happen again, as it happened with Wolkswagen in late 2008 before GME.

                Rather of hunting for the next short squeeze, educate yourself on financial literacy and how to save for the future. The
                stock market isn't a casino, and it shouldn't be treated that way. Learn how to invest wisely and you will profit both
                personally and financially.
